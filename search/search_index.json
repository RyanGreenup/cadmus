What is Cadmus? \u00b6 Cadmus provides command driven interface to find and edit Markdown files, such as finding by name, searching for terms, filtering by tags, generating backlinks and generating relative links to other notes. How does it Work \u00b6 Cadmus is just a bunch of shell scripts that essentially use pipes and ripgrep with skim to display them. How Do i Use It \u00b6 Installation \u00b6 cadmus is available on the AUR , generally however cadmus will operate in a portable fashion from =~/.cadmus/=, so just using git is fine as well: cd $( mktemp -d ) wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RyanGreenup/cadmus/master/install.sh bash install.sh Note To remove it it is sufficient to perform: rm -rf \" $HOME /.cadmus\" rm ~/.local/bin/cadmus Warning This assumes that the dependencies have all been installed and recoll is indexing the directory of your notes. Usage \u00b6 Just run cadmus at the terminal and it will walk you through generating a config file. Afterwards running cadmus will show various commands such as find and search that can be used to work with your knowledge base. Note Shortly functionality will be implemented to allow creating a .cadmus file in any directory that will act as a config for all markdown files beneath that directory, this is useful if you want to use cadmus with documentation for a project and still have access to your notes, or have multiple knowledge bases. When or Why Would I Use This \u00b6 Well I wrote this because my interests are Math and Data Sci and quite frankly I suffer from information overload, I like open-source stuff, simple scripts and unix philosophy so if any of that resonates with you try it out. This is all modular so take what you like and reimplement it, fork it, make PR's and please fell free to post issues even if it's just to say Hey, I like tool x have you tried it before? . Background \u00b6 The idea of cadmus is to demonstrate how powerful the terminal can be and how it can act as a functional replacement for tools like OneNote or Evernote.

From there usually you will want to extract both types of tags so press b , cadmus will sync the tags between your notes and TMSU 1 When Would This Be Used \u00b6 This needs to be used every time your tags are changed in order to bring tmsu back in sync, otherwise when you look for tags it won't show the correct notes. Example \u00b6 How does it Work \u00b6 Hash tags \u00b6 Hash tags are easy, just use ripgrep with pcre2 : rg --pcre2 '(?<=\\s#)[a-zA-Z]+(?=\\s)' -t markdown -o $NOTE_DIR \\ | sed s+:+ \\ + | sed s/^/tmsu \\ tag \\ / YAML Tags \u00b6 This is a little more involved, it's essentially a couple of `for`` loops over the files, I did it in R first but it was too slow so I redid it in NodeJS , checkout these files for the source code: /bin/tags/yaml-parse.js /home/ryan/.cadmus/bin/tags/ListTags.R Integrating with Vim \u00b6 I put these lines in my .vimrc to generate a list and filter tags using FZF.vim: imap < expr > < C - c >< C - y > fzf# vim # complete ( 'node ~/bin/printMarkdownTags/yaml-parse.js $HOME/Notes/MD/notes \\| sort -u' ) imap < expr > < C - c >< C - t > fzf# vim # complete ( 'rg --pcre2 \"\\s#[a-zA-Z-@]+\\s\" -o --no-filename $HOME/Notes/MD -t md \\| sort -u' ) Dependencies \u00b6 This requires, TMSU, nodejs and ripgrep with pcre2.
