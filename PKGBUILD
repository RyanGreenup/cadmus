# check_for_dependencies



# TODO hmm, the config file would probably have to go in ~/.config/cadmus/config.json for this to work well.
# TODO Need to fix file system permissions error
# TODO I need to have a centralised list of dependencies, currently they are listed in:
#
#    1. README
#    1. Install.sh
#    1. This MakePkg
#        1. up in the depends Array
#        1. here in the depArray warning
# TODO Should I be installing everything to ~/.cadmus or should I throw all the scripts into /usr/bin?
#
#
# PROS; the portability is convenient and motivates users to look at the scripts
#         and investigate them
# PROS; the portability means I don't have to package for other distros
#
# CONS; maybe having the individual scripts in /usr/bin would be simpler to install
# CONS; maybe having the individual scripts in PATH would be better for users
#
}




# Could I make building TMSU a part of the pkg build or should I leave that seperate???

# If I wanted to search for packages that contain a binary (say ip) i could do:

#sudo pacman -Fy
#sudo pacman -F ip
