#+TITLE: Changelog
 - Find/Search Now also supports ~org~ files
 - Switched from ~mdcat~ back to ~bat~, because
   + ~bat~ works with ~.org~ without needing to use org-ruby or pandoc
   + Still having issues with ~mdcat~ not displaying results ocasionally (is this an issue with footnotes?)
 - Added Rofi Menu
   + This doesn't work yet
     - Rofi_find doesn't disown the browser for some reason
     - Does not return the matched file name
     - things typed in to rofi are not remembered after a preview
 - Added a tag Py Script
   + This doesn't work yet
     - using str-split to seperate filename and tag doesn't work well because
       ~:~ characters in the heading become a tag seperator.
     - I can't use look behind because it is a non-constant length
