#+TITLE: Changelog
 - Find/Search Now also supports ~org~ files
 - Switched from ~mdcat~ back to ~bat~, because
   + ~bat~ works with ~.org~ without needing to use org-ruby or pandoc
   + Still having issues with ~mdcat~ not displaying results ocasionally (is this an issue with footnotes?)
 - Added Rofi Menu
