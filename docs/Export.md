# Export
!!! note
    Start this with `cadmus export`

## What does it do

This provides options for exporting notes using $\LaTeX$ and `pandoc`

## How Do I use it

!!! warning 
    This requires [LaTeX](https://www.lesbonscomptes.com/recoll/) or Tectonic, as well as a recent version of pandoc. 

Just run `cadmus export pdf/html/docs` and skim will pop up and offer notes to choose from.

## When Would This Be Used

Grat for sharing notes with somebody who doesn't want Markdown.

### Example

## How does it Work

This simply uses pandoc, just search for `pandoc` inside `bin/cadmus`
