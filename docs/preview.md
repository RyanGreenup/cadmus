# Preview
!!! note
    Start this with `cadmus preview`

## What does it do

This starts [markserv](https://github.com/markserv/markserv) in the notes directory and prints a qr code to the terminal.

## How Do I use it

!!! warning 
    This requires markserv and qrencode.

Just run `cadmus preview` or `cadmus preview!` for global, to view your notes with makserv.

## When Would This Be Used

This is good for previewing your notes similar to what they might look like on *GitHub*, the global `preview!` can be good to read notes on an *iPad* or share with friends over the LAN (think on campus).

### Example

 #TODO

## How does it Work

This just uses ordinary calls to `MarkServ`
