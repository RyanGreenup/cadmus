## What does it do

This provides options for transforming the clipboard into other markup languages for quick copy paste.

## How Do I use it

!!! warning 
    This requires [LaTeX](https://www.lesbonscomptes.com/recoll/) or Tectonic, as well as a recent version of pandoc. 

Just run `cadmus convert org2md/md2mediawiki/...` and the clipboard will be transformed from one markup language into the other.

## When Would This Be Used

This is great for taking stuff of *Wikipedia* or for using *Dokuwiki* or `org-mode`.

### Example
